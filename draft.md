upon believing that you have completed work sufficient to write a peer reviewed manuscript, follow the following steps, basically in order):

1. 1 sentence summary (will become your title;  ~5 min)
2. 1 paragraph summary (will become your abstract;  ~30 min)
  1. big opportunity sentence: what is the grandest opportunity that this work is addressing?
  1. specific opportunity: what opportuntity specifically will this manuscript address?
  2. challenge sentence: what is hard about addressing this opportunity?
  3. gap sentence: what is currently missing?
  3. action sentence: what did you do to address the gap, overcome the challenge, and therefore meet the opportunity?
  4. resolution sentence: what changes for the reader now that you have met this
challenge? 

3. 5 paragraph intro
  3. bulleted list of  ~3-5 main factors that create an opportunity for your work (~20 min)
  4. 1 sentence summary of the **gap**, that is, the key ingredient that is missing (~5 min)
  4. bulleted list of the ~3-5 main challenges that must be overcome (~20 min)
  4. 2-3 sentence summary of what you did (~5 min)
  5. 2-3 sentence summary on how your work changes the world (~5 min)
4. outline the results: list the evidence that supports that you filled the gap (the fewer points you need, the better)
  1. 1 sentence summary of result 1, and a description of the figure that makes the point as clearly as possible, without making any other extraneous points (~5 min).
  2. same for result 2.
  3. etc.
5. outline of discussion, to include
  1. bulleted list of previous related work (~20 min)
  2. bulleted list of potential extensions (~20 min)
6. outline of methods, to include:
  1. plain text description of algorithm
  1. pseudocode
  1. simulation settings
  1. real data settings
  1. evaluation dimensions (see [algorithms.md](algorithms.md))
