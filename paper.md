check all these things before submitting a paper:

1. title < 80 characters
2. abstract < 250 words
3. first sentence of every paragraph describes the entire paragraph
3. last sentence of every paragraph links to next paragraph
4. no misspelled words
5. all figures satisfy figure checklist
6. table captions are above tables (unlike figure captions)
7. none of the words/phrases in words.md were used
8. ratio of contents is approximately 20:60:20 for intro:results:discussion
9. when introducing a novel concept/word/equation/notation/etc., always explain it *before* usage, rather than after; else the reader will not understand when reading it, and we don't want that!
