1. describe simulated settings---via formal generative process---for:
  1. one setting for which you suspect alg A will perform very well
  2. one setting for which you suspect alg A will perform poorly, but alg A' will perform well (for some A')

2. describe metrics for evaluation, including (statistical, computational) per trial, meaning need to specify
  1. what is the statistical metric (eg, mean squared error)
  2. what is the computational metric (eg, walltime)

3. list set of alg's under consideration, including hyper-parameter settings for each, provide citation for each
4. run each alg on each simulation, record (stats,comp) numbers for each trial
5. plot pairwise comparisons for each trial
6. compute statistics in reference to benchmark for each metric, trial
7. compute summary statistics for each metric over set of trials
