### Describe

1. simulated settings (formally describe the generative process for $\geq 2$ settings):
   1. one for which you suspect alg A will perform very well
   2. one for which you suspect alg A will perform poorly, but alg A' will perform well
2. describe metrics for evaluation, including (statistical, computational) per trial, meaning need to specify
   1. what is the statistical metric (eg, mean squared error)
   2. what is the computational metric (eg, walltime)
3. set of alg's under consideration

### Conduct

1. run each alg on each simulation, record (stats,comp) numbers for each trial
2. plot pairwise comparisons for each trial
3. compute statistics
