### Real Data

1. run [algorithms](algorithms.md) on simulated data first
2. select and describe datasets, including at least 1 (dataset, algorithm) pair for which we have published benchmark results
17. predict performance accuracy of the algorithm each real data set
18. run *exact same code* on real data as ran on simulations, generating estimates, qualitative and quantitative results. 
19. document performance accuracy relative to predictions, modify understanding as appropriate
