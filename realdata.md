### Real Data

1. run [algorithms](algorithms.md) on simulated data first
17. predict performance accuracy of the algorithm on real data
18. run *exact same code* on real data, generating estimates, qualitative and quantitative results. 
19. document performance accuracy relative to predictions, modify understanding as appropriate
