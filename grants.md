when writing a grant, to any funding agency:

1. for each task, include a **bold** sentence precisely and concisely stating its objective
2. make sure to distinguish your own work from others explicitly every time your work is cited
3. check that formatting is consistent across *all* documents (both within type, eg biosketches) and across.

### NSF specific

#### Overview page:

1. for summary, focus on gap and impact
2. for intellectual merit, use as much language from [NSF Big Ideas](http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/documents/Big%20Ideas%20compiled.pdf) as possible
3. broader impacts is about societal, not intellectual benefit, focusing on STEM education, minorities, disabilities, open source, etc.


### NIH specific


### if using google docs

- recall that must page numbers must be added somehow (e.g., by exporting as a word document)
- use [paperpile](https://paperpile.com/) for references (free version for 2 weeks)
- use [auto-latex](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/auto-latex-equations/iaainhiejkciadlhlodaajgbffkebdog?hl=en-US) for equations
- keep figures at very end until last opportunity
