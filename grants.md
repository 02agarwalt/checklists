when writing a grant, to any funding agency:

1. for each task, include a **bold** sentence precisely and concisely stating its objective
2. make sure to distinguish your own work from others explicitly every time your work is cited

### NSF specific

#### Overview page:

1. for summary, focus on gap and impact
2. for intellectual merit, use as much language from [NSF Big Ideas](http://www.sciencemag.org/sites/default/files/documents/Big%20Ideas%20compiled.pdf) as possible
3. broader impacts is about societal, not intellectual benefit, focusing on STEM education, minorities, disabilities, open source, etc.


### NIH specific
