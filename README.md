# checklists

Surgeons have a simple [checklist](http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/44186/2/9789241598590_eng_Checklist.pdf) that they fill out for every surgery.  Evidence suggests that these checklists, while tedious, are [extremely effective](http://www.who.int/patientsafety/safesurgery/checklist_saves_lives/en/).

we thought data scientists should have checklists too, so we started making some.
please add more checklists, or improve the existing ones!
