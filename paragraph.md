things to check for each paragraph

10. first: somebody reading this will think they did it first, and they are at least partially correct. firstness should be implied by context.
1. sequence old to new: start with previously introduced concepts before exposing readers to new concepts
2. sequence light to heavy: sequence sentences with sentences that start light/succint, follow-up with "heavy" details
3. use transitional words to establish logical relationship between sentences
4. use "echo words", ie, be consistent with nomenclature to bury the concept into their heads
5. use strong verbs, action verbs, rather than passive verbs.
