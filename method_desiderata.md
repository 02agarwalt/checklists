properties to consider upon evaluating a methodology for solving a problem:

1. statistical considerations
	1. theoretical properties
		1. feasible region of action space
		2. complexity (size) of action space
		3. how robust to which model misspecifications
	2. empirical properties
		3. empirical bias on exemplar problems for which optimal solution lives in action space
		4. empirical variance on exemplar problems for which optimal solution lives in action space
		3. empircal robustness in above mentioned model misspecifications
2. computational considerations
	1. theoretical complexity
	2. wall time/space

| 		| space | time 	|
| :--- 	| :--- 	| 		|
| train |  		| 		| 
| test 	| 		| 		| 


3. implementation considerations
	2. code available?
	3. open source?
	4. reasonably licensed?
	5. installation ease, including:
		1. clear instructions?
		2. dependencies easy to deal with?
		3. 1-line installable?
		6. virtualized?
4. platform considerations, does it run on
	1. CPU
	2. GPU
	3. Cluster
	4. Mobile
